  <h2>Filesystem Layout</h2>

  <p>The root filesystem has the immutable attribute set on OSTree installations,
  so /, /usr and everything below it is readonly. /var is where all the runtime
  state is kept. There are some symlinks that put the state-carrying directories
  in their traditional, expected place:
  <ul>
    <li>/home → /var/home</li>
    <li>/opt → /var/opt</li>
    <li>/srv → /var/srv</li>
    <li>/root → /var/roothome</li>
    <li>/usr/local → /var/usrlocal</li>
    <li>/mnt → /var/mnt</li>
    <li>/tmp → /sysroot/tmp</li>
  </ul>
  and so on. If you have a separate home partition on your system, it should be
  mounted on /var/home.</p>

  <p>For a more detailed explanation of the system layout, refer to the excellent
  <a href="https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/adapting-existing/">libostree documentation</a>
  on this subject.</a>

  <h2>Packaging: ostree, rpms, flatpaks and containers</h2>

  <p><em>ostree</em> is responsible for deploying and updating the OS image (ie everything
  below / that is not symlinked into /var). ostree also contains the necessary logic to update
  grub.cfg entries to point to the current image.</p>

  <p><em>rpm-ostree</em> builds on top of ostree, and makes it possible to install rpms as a
  'layer' on top of an ostree image. In practice, that means you can install rpms
  as usual, just use rpm-ostree install instead of dnf install. What happens under
  the covers is that rpm-ostree will compose a new OS image by adding the rpm payload
  to the existing OS image, and creating a new, combined image. To see the newly
  installed rpms, you have to reboot into the new image. rpm-ostree also takes care
  of recreating the layered image whenever you update the base OS image.</p>

  <p><em>flatpak</em> uses container technologies to deploy and run desktop applications isolated
  from the underlying OS.</p>

  <p>You can of course use other container tools like <em>podman</em> or <em>buildah</em> to
  run other containers on a Silverblue system.</p>

  <h2>Using Flatpak</h2>

  <p>If you don't want to use the <em>flatpak</em> commandline tools, GNOME Software has excellent
  support for installing Flatpaks. There are several repositories that provide Flatpaks.</p>

  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://flathub.org">Flathub</a> is a convenient place to find many popular desktop apps
  <li><a href="https://sdk.gnome.org/gnome-apps-nightly.flatpakrepo">GNOME nightly</a> provides builds of unstable GNOME apps
  <li><a href="https://firefox-flatpak.mojefedora.cz/org.mozilla.FirefoxNightly.flatpakref">Firefox nightly</a>
  <li><a href="http://eclipse.matbooth.co.uk/">Eclipse nightly</a>
  </ul>

  <p>Once you have repositories enabled, you can use GNOME Software's excellent support
  for searching Flatpaks. Or you can use <em>flatpak search</em>.</p>

  <h2>Using Package Layering</h2>

  <p>Package layering works by re-composing the OS image locally, while adding extra rpm packages
  to it. This is done with the <em>rpm-ostree install</em> command. Once a package has been layered,
  rpm-ostree will keep it up-to-date for you and recreate the layer when you install a newer OS
  image.</p>

  <p>You can also remove a package from OS image. The command to do this is
  <em>rpm-ostree override remove</em>.</p>

  <p>rpm-ostree does not currently have an equivalent to the <em>dnf search</em> command for finding
  packages in the configured repositories. As a workaround, you can run dnf in a temporary container
  like this:</p>

  <p>$ sudo podman run --rm fedora:28 dnf search <i>TERM</i></p>

  <h2>Enabling third-party RPM Repositories</h2>

  <p>Silverblue installs a number of yum repositories containing useful software that is not
  part of Fedora proper for various reasons. You can enable these repositories either during
  the initial setup of an new install, or from the "Software Repositories" dialog in GNOME
  Software.</p>
